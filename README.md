# New Super Mario Bros 2D All Stars

A side-scrolling Super Mario platformer built from scratch with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and Claude Code (Opus 4.6 1M).

Three worlds, two players, mushrooms, pipes, Yoshi — and a tongue that eats Goombas. Plug in a controller or grab the keyboard and go.

## Play online

Click to play in your browser: https://marcocesari.github.io/new_super_mario_bros_2d_all_stars

> Hosted on the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). The first load takes a few seconds while the music files download. Click anywhere on the canvas first — browsers block audio until you interact with the page.

## Features

- **3 themed worlds** — sky 1-1, underground 1-2, and a sunset 1-3
- **Local co-op** — play solo as Mario or grab a friend to join as Luigi
- **Yoshi!** — hatch him from green eggs, ride him, and eat enemies with his tongue
- **Power-ups** — `?` blocks pop mushrooms that make Mario big (and let him take a hit)
- **Enemies** — Goombas: stomp them or eat them with Yoshi
- **Controller support** — auto-detects Bluetooth gamepads with a guided button-mapping screen
- **Original soundtracks** — ground theme, level clear, lost-a-life, game over

## Controls

### Keyboard — 1 player

| Action          | Key            |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Move            | `←` / `→`      |
| Jump            | `Space`        |
| Get off Yoshi   | `↑`            |
| Call Yoshi      | `↓`            |
| Yoshi eat       | `Shift`        |
| Restart         | `R`            |

### Keyboard — 2 players

|                 | P1 (Mario)     | P2 (Luigi)     |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Move            | `←` / `→`      | `A` / `D`      |
| Jump            | `Space`        | `W`            |

### Controller

Pick **"I have a controller"** from the main menu. The setup screen will walk you through pairing your gamepad and mapping each button (move, jump, eat, dismount, call Yoshi, restart). Works with any standard Bluetooth pad — analog stick or D-pad both fine.

## How to play

- **Stomp** Goombas from above.
- **Hit `?` blocks** from underneath. Some give coins, some give mushrooms, some hatch a Yoshi egg.
- **Mount Yoshi** by walking into him. While riding, press the eat button to flick out his tongue and swallow nearby enemies.
- **Reach the flag** at the end of the level to clear it.
- **Don't fall in the pits.** Ever.
